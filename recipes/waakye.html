        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Waakye <strong>(/ˈwɑːtʃeɪ/ WAH-chay)</strong> or Awaakye is a Ghanaian dish of cooked rice and beans, commonly eaten for breakfast or lunch. However, others eat it for supper. The rice and beans, usually black eyed peas or cow beans, are cooked together, 
            along with red dried sorghum leaf sheaths or stalks and limestone.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <p>To make waakye, you need:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>dried millet leaves’ this is what makes it waakye. Without it, it is just rice and beans. 
                        Don’t bother making it without the millet leaves, your efforts will not be appreciated.</li>
                    <li>beans: you can use any beans of choice, preferably the small ones (red beans, black eyed, reddish brown, etc). 
                        I prefer black eyed beans/ peas because it cooks faster and looks nice with the rice.</li>
                    <li>rice of choice</li>        
                </ul>
            
            </p>
            <p>Serve the waakye with this beef stew, 
                fried fish stew or gizzard sauce with some shito on the side.

        <h2>Steps</h2>    
        <p>How to prepare Waakye</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour over a litre of water into a saucepan together with the 
                    millet leaf stalks. Put on high heat to boil. 
                    The millet stalk leaves will start omitting its colour 
                    and the water will start turning into a deep wine colour.</li>
                <li>Rinse the soaked beans and add to the boiling water. 
                    Cover and let it cook till tender. Mean while rinse the rice till the water is cleared. 
                    Add the washed rice into the saucepan together with salt to taste. (You might need to add more water.) Add water if needed. 
                    Stir and cover tightly.</li>
                <li>Do not remove the millet stalk leaves. When the rice boils over, reduce heat and simmer till the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked through. 
                    Rest for three to five minutes, remove millet stalk leaves and fluff with a fork.</li>        
            </ol>
